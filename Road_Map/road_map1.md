Great to know you're already working as a Software Developer with 5 years of experience! Since you're looking to revisit and sharpen your skills while preparing for roles in **product-based companies**, I'll suggest a structured roadmap that helps you:

1. **Brush up on fundamentals** and review advanced topics.
2. **Deepen your expertise** in core areas.
3. **Level up your technical profile** for better opportunities.

Here's how you can start:

---

### üöÄ **1. Brush Up on Core Skills & Concepts**

#### **a) Java ‚Äì Deepen Knowledge**

Since you're already familiar with Java, you can focus on:

* **Advanced Concepts:** Concurrency, Multi-threading, Design Patterns (Singleton, Factory, Observer, etc.), Garbage Collection, JVM Internals, Memory Management.
* **Concurrency & Multithreading**: Use Java‚Äôs `ExecutorService`, `Future`, `ThreadPoolExecutor`, etc.
* **Java 8+ Features:** Streams, Lambda Expressions, Functional Interfaces, Optional, and new Date/Time API.
* **JVM Internals:** Learn about JVM‚Äôs memory structure (Heap, Stack, PermGen, Metaspace), Class Loaders, Garbage Collection algorithms, etc.
* **Resources:**

  * **Book:** ‚ÄúEffective Java‚Äù by Joshua Bloch
  * **YouTube:** Tech With Tim (Java tutorials)

---

#### **b) Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**

Since you're already familiar with some of the tools, revisiting **DSA** is a must for top product-based companies.

* **Key Areas:** Arrays, Linked Lists, Binary Search, Sorting algorithms, Trees (BST, AVL, Segment Trees), Graphs, Dynamic Programming, Recursion, Backtracking, Divide and Conquer.
* **Platform to Practice:**

  * **LeetCode** (for daily problem solving)
  * **Codeforces** (for competitive programming challenges)
  * **GeeksforGeeks** (structured problem sets)

Focus on both **easy**, **medium**, and **hard** problems. Make sure to focus on **time complexity** and **space complexity** as well.

---

#### **c) SQL & Databases**

Since you're familiar with SQL and MySQL, here‚Äôs how you can take it to the next level:

* **Advanced SQL:** Window Functions, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), Subqueries, Joins, Indexing, Query Optimization.
* **Database Design:** Normalization, Denormalization, ER diagrams, Transactions, ACID Properties, Database Scaling.
* **PL/SQL**: Focus on stored procedures, triggers, packages, and cursors for deeper understanding.

Consider working on some **real-world database projects** or systems that use **SQL** + **NoSQL** (like MongoDB) for exposure to diverse systems.

---

### üöÄ **2. Learn Advanced Frameworks & Tools**

#### **a) Spring Framework (Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, Spring Security, etc.)**

You mentioned you‚Äôre familiar with **Spring Boot** basics. Let's go deeper:

* **Spring Boot:**

  * Focus on **RESTful API development**, **Spring Security** for authentication and authorization.
  * Understand **Spring Boot Actuator**, **Profiles**, **Spring Data JPA** integration, **Spring Batch**, etc.
* **Spring Cloud**: Learn about microservices architecture, service discovery (Eureka), circuit breakers (Hystrix), Config Server, and message brokers (Kafka, RabbitMQ).
* **Testing:** Get comfortable with **JUnit** + **Mockito**, and integration testing with Spring Boot.

**Resources:**

* "Spring in Action" (Book by Craig Walls)
* Spring official documentation and guides.
* YouTube: Java Brains, Spring Academy

---

#### **b) Kafka & Message Queues**

You have some exposure to **Kafka**, but it's time to become proficient in it:

* **Concepts:** Producers, Consumers, Topics, Partitions, Consumer Groups, Offset Management, Kafka Streams.
* Learn how to build **Event-Driven Microservices** using Kafka.
* **Resources:**

  * Confluent‚Äôs [Kafka tutorial](https://developer.confluent.io/learn-kafka/)
  * "Kafka: The Definitive Guide" (Book)

---

#### **c) Docker & Containers**

Deepen your knowledge of Docker:

* **Docker Compose:** Multi-container application setup.
* **Docker Networking & Volumes**
* **Dockerizing Spring Boot apps**

Also, get exposure to **Kubernetes** for container orchestration, as it‚Äôs a key skill for many product-based companies.

**Resources:**

* **Docker Docs**: [https://docs.docker.com/](https://docs.docker.com/)
* **Kubernetes Official Docs**

---

#### **d) CI/CD Tools (Jenkins, Bitbucket, etc.)**

Since you're familiar with **Jenkins** and **BitBucket**, here's what to focus on:

* **Jenkins Pipelines:** Understand the different types of Jenkins pipelines (Declarative vs Scripted), integration with GitHub, automated deployment using **Docker** and **Kubernetes**.
* Learn **GitLab CI/CD** or **CircleCI** to broaden your experience.

---

### üöÄ **3. Build Projects & Real-World Experience**

Focus on building **full-stack systems** or **microservices-based applications** to showcase:

* **Microservices** with Spring Boot, Kafka, Docker.
* **RESTful APIs** with Spring Boot + JPA + PostgreSQL or MongoDB.
* **Frontend**: A simple UI using React or Angular if you want full-stack exposure.
* **Authentication & Authorization**: Implement OAuth 2.0, JWT for secure APIs.

**Showcase your Projects on GitHub** and make them open-source to demonstrate your skills.

---

### üöÄ **4. Prepare for Interviews (for Product-Based Companies)**

#### **a) Interview Prep Strategy**

* **DSA:** Practice coding problems daily (LeetCode, Codeforces).
* **System Design:** Learn how to design scalable and reliable systems.
* **Behavioral Interview:** Prepare for **STAR method** questions on your past projects.

#### **b) Resources:**

* **System Design Primer** (GitHub repository)
* **YouTube**: Gaurav Sen (System Design), Tech Dummies (System Design)
* **Mock Interviews:** Platforms like **Pramp**, **Interviewing.io** to practice mock interviews.

---

### üöÄ **5. Networking & Getting the Right Opportunities**

* **Referrals:** Leverage your LinkedIn and GitHub to get **referrals** from people in product-based companies.
* **Apply through job portals** (LinkedIn Jobs, AngelList for startups) or directly through company career pages.
* **Connect with recruiters:** You can reach out to recruiters from companies like Google, Amazon, or Microsoft for insights and referrals.

### üöÄ **6. Consider Getting Certifications**

Certifications in areas like **AWS** (Solutions Architect), **Azure**, or **Google Cloud** can boost your profile, especially in cloud computing-heavy product companies.

---

### üöÄ **Bonus: Regular Review & Consistency**

* Dedicate at least **2‚Äì3 hours daily** to brushing up DSA and learning new concepts.
* Keep improving your **problem-solving skills** and **project quality** as you progress.
